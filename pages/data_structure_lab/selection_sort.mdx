# Selection Sort

The **Selection sort** algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Procedure

```mdx
1. Initialize minimum value(min_idx) to location 0.
2. Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array.
3. While traversing if any element smaller than min_idx is found then swap both the values.
4. Then, increment min_idx to point to the next element.
5. Repeat until the array is sorted.
```
