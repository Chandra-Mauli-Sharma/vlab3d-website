# Linked List

A **Linked list** is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order.

## Operation

The _INSERT_ operation on a stack is often called _PUSH_, and the _DELETE_ operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called _POP_.

These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible.

## Algorithm

**Insertion**

```mdx
void insertStart(struct Node head, int data){

    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = *head;

    *head = newNode;

}
```

**Deletion**

```mdx
void deleteNode(struct node \**head, int key)
{
struct node *temp;

      if(*head->data == key)
      {
          temp = *head;
          *head = (*head)->next;
          free(temp);
      }

}
```
