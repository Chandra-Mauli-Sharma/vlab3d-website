# Stack

In a **Stack**, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out,or LIFO, policy.

## Operation

The _INSERT_ operation on a stack is often called _PUSH_, and the _DELETE_ operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called _POP_.

These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible.
